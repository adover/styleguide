# Styleguide

This codebase is a port of the work I did alone to build a working SASS design system/styleguide for one of the largest retailers in NZ. Due to the size of the business the pace there is "enterprise speed", so I have forked this repo to work on developing and improving at a more rapid rate.

This is a styleguide built using SASS and will in future contain:
- Design tokens
- SassDoc
- Unit tests
- Lots of cool tools for generating stuff
- And more...
